## The Idea
For out final project, we want to build a fully functioning Computer System for a Cereal Shop. This includes a database, an api for easy access, a basic security system and multiple webpages. The pages function as clients, which means that they will have their own logic to ensure requirements consisting security and privacy.

Because we can't use a real shop, we would like to simulate all the necessary functions a real shop would have. Therfore we will programm small "Helpers" that will simulate real people.

## Requirements
Because we are thinking about a real shop application, we have to consider a few requirments:

| Requirment                            | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy Deployable                       | The whole system should be deployable with minimal effort.   |
| Fully simulated                       | The system should be able to simulate all necessary functions of a shop. This includes the process of buing Items, sselling items and leaving comments. |
| Scalable                              | If necessary, it should be possible to easily expand the system, either to use more webpages, another api or more simulated helpers. |
| Security functions should be provided | Every actor in our system gets a role, for example customer or Manager. No customer should be able to see the same Information as the manager.  It should be easy for the enduser to access the nessesary data. |
| Protection of personal data           | The System should be conform with the newest standarts in the security of personal data. We would like to make sure that the data we use for analyses is anonymous, so there is no way that the data could lead to a person. |

### 
## The data itself
The data we are using for our System is coming from different sources. We have amazon comments from Kabel, Produkts from us, and a random name list from out site.
