## Let's go to work

### Structures and first inits

First of all, we had to create a structure for our Github Project:
```
├── Data
├── LICENSE.md
├── Planing
├── README.md
├── Texte
└── src
    ├── Task\ 1\ -\ Databse
    ├── Task\ 2\ -\ API
    ├── Task\ 2.1\ -\ Authentication\ Service
    ├── Task\ 3\ -\ Customer
    ├── Task\ 4\ -\ Deliverer
    ├── Task\ 5\ -\ Employer
    ├── Task\ 6\ -\ Employe
    ├── Task\ 7\ -\ Standart\ Seite
    ├── Task\ 8\ -\ Website\ Customer
    ├── Task\ 9\ -\ Website\ Managment
    ├── Task\ 99\ -\ Docker
    └── readme.md
```

|Folder|Info|
|---|---|
|Data|contains all Nesescary .csv Files with the Data we use in our Shop|
|Planing| contains all Models and Graphs for the Planing of our System|
|Texte| contains all Pictures and .md files we use for our Final assignment|
|src| Because we have so many Microservices, we devide them in single Tasks, which are stored in seperate Folders.|
